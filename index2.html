        <h2 class="text-center">About Us</h2>
        <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, founder of Maratha empire in western India in 1664, was well known for his forts. Many, like Panhala Fort and Rajgad, existed before him but others, like Sindhudurg and Pratapgad, were built by him from scratch.[1]
            Also, the fort of Raigad was built as the place of throne, i.e., the capital, of Maratha Empire by Hirojee Indulkar on the orders of the Chhatrapati. This is the place where Shivaji was crowned and today also his Samadhi (shrine) stands in
            front of the Jagadishwar temple. These forts were central to his empire and their remains are among the foremost sources of information about his rule. The French missionary Father Fryer witnessed the fortifications of Gingee, Madras, built
            by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj after its conquest, and appreciated his technical know-how and knowledge.[citation needed] Sindhudurg was built in order to control attacks by Portuguese and Siddhis on the coastal areas of the Maratha Empire.
            This fort is the witness of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's navy which was later led by Kanhoji Angre in times of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's grandson Chhatrapati Shahu I, and came to glory. Also, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built the forts
            of Colaba and Underi to control the activities of the Siddhis in the Arabian Sea. At the time of Underi's construction, the British opposed a lot and stood with their warships in the sea to obstacle the material being supplied for the construction
            of the fort. But to their surprise, the material required for construction was being supplied with the help of small boats at night. The hill fort of Salher in Nashik district was at a distance of 1,200 km (750 mi) from the hill fort Gingee,
            near Chennai. Over such long distance, hill forts were supported by seaforts. The seafort, Kolaba Fort, near Mumbai, was at a distance of 500 km (310 mi) from the seafort Sindhudurg.

                            Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha ruler, along with the his chief engineer Hiroji Indulkar, oversaw the construction and development of various buildings and structures within Raigad. In 1674, after being crowned the
                            king of the Maratha Kingdom of the Konkan, Shivaji chose Raigad as his capital.

                        <p class="card-text"> the year 1657 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj became too powerful to be tolerated, for the rulers of Vijapur. His strength was on rise. He used to conquer new provinces of Vijapur kingdom from time to time. To restrain Shivaji Maharaj,
                            Afzalkhan was deputed, but Shivaji Maharaj tactfully assassinated him. This incident is recorded in the history in great details. The tomb of Afzalkhan still exists there. It is built at levelled ground on the third stage of
                            down slope amid trees. Pratapgad fort is famous for beauty of nature in and around it.

                            There is small temple of Goddess Shivai and idols of Jijabai (Mother of Shri Shivaji) and Shivaji in his childhood. The shape of Shivneri fort is like Shiv-Pind (Shiva’s sacred symbol; Divine Phallus). This fort is visible
                            as soon as you enter Junnar town. This fort is not that big in area. Dr. John Friar of East India Company visited this fort in 1673.

                            of Maharashtra, 450 kilometres south of Mumbai. The fort was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj of the Maratha Empire. The construction of the fort began in 1664 and took three years to complete. The main objective was to
                            counter the rising influence of foreign colonizers (English, Dutch, French, and Portuguese merchants) and to curb the rise of the Siddis of Janjira.
